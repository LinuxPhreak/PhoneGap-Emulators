And at the same time serve the purpose of being able to test phone gap projects.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Final releases</strong>\r\n<br />\r\nFinal releases of these emulators will hopefully be able to test most supported features of Phone Gap projects. Such as reconizing phone numbers and treating them properly. Weather it is to open up the SMS app of a phone or the dialer of a phone. If the phone gap project accesses the photo gallery or camera these emulators should emulate the that as well. \r\n\r\n<strong>Windows Phone Emulator</strong>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Windows Phone Emulator is obviosly the easiest. Mainly because we can easily implement Internet Explorer features into the project. This means we can easily mimic the IE mobile browser. \r\n\r\n<strong>iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad/iPad Mini</strong>\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a bit more complicated. The best route I have thought of is using the Web Kit Libraries. \r\n\r\n<strong>Notes to users</strong>\r\n<br />\r\nThis is still a work in progress. Alot of features currently work for the Windows Phone. However the iPhone, Android Phone, Black Berry Phones have not even been built yet. Not to mention that some of the features in the Windows Phone are still not availible as of this time.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
